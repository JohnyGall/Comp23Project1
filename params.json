You play as a troubled Tufts \r\nComputer Science student trying to finish your Game Development project on time.\r\nYou must exploit the resolution bug in your game in order to get to the end\r\nand fix the bug before your Game Development project is due.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nControls:\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nLeft/Right Arrow Keys — Move left or right; in the main menu and in cutscenes,\r\n                        move forward in dialog.\r\n\r\nUp Arrow Key — Jump; hold down for longer jumps\r\n\r\nDown Arrow — Fast fall; press while in the air to immediately fall downwards\r\n\r\nSpacebar — Bitshift; change between low and high resolution worlds\r\n\r\nP - Pause/Unpause\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are secret debug keys\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nInteractables:\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nBoulders — Round rocks that can be rolled up or down hills and which block \r\n           turret fire. In high-res, that is. In the low-res world, boulders\r\n           are not affected by gravity, have square corners, and function as\r\n           stable platforms.\r\n\r\nTurrets — Enemies that fire dangerous one-hit-kill projectiles at the player.\r\n          In high-res, the turrets fire bullets that move extremely quickly.\r\n          The bullets are small, however, and have a visible bar showing the\r\n          time until the next bullet is fired. In low-res, the bullets are much\r\n          larger, and fire more rapidly. However they fire at a lower frequency,\r\n          making low-res turrets a sort of bullet-hell obstacle.\r\n\r\nSlopes — Slopes are hills in the game levels that, in the high-res world, can\r\n         be used as slides.\r\n\r\nClouds — Clouds in the high-res world act like regular clouds: puffy little\r\n         water friends that sit around doing nothing and not interacting with\r\n         the world. They can be walked or jumped through. In low-res, clouds\r\n         form solid platforms the player slowly drips through, though they \r\n         cannot be passed through from below, leading to timing puzzles where \r\n         in order to access an area the player must bitshift to pass through the\r\n         cloud and then turn to the low-resolution world to stand on the cloud.\r\n\r\nSpikes — Spikes are deadly in high-res, but act as useful platforms in low-res.\r\n\r\nCheckpoints — Shaped like the outline of the player in high-res and an \r\n              amorphous blob in low-res, checkpoints are the places from which\r\n              a dead player will respawn.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nLevels:\r\n--------------------\r\nLevel 1 — Grass\r\nLevel 2 — Ice\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nCompatibility:\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nBitshift was written in JavaScript using the Phaser game engine [1]. It depends\r\nexternally on Google Web Fonts, though this is not a game-making functionality.\r\nThe game should run in most modern browsers and had been tested in the most\r\nrecent versions of Chrome / Firefox / Opera, as of the due date (10/20/2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] http://phaser.io/\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
